# Kranio-Interview
Solution to questions asked at Kranio's Interview.
In order to be able to change strings to date format in PySpark, at least in my computer, I had to set the spark sessions' configuration with the command  "spark.conf.set("spark.sql.legacy.timeParserPolicy","LEGACY")". It is possible that other computers might need deleting than line or setting another configuration.  
Data should be imported from user's folder where the user has downloaded the dataset from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/akshaypawar7/millions-of-movies.

I saved the code as a Jupyter notebook because it is easier to interact with Pyplot using that format.
